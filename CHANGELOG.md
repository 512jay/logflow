# 📦 Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented here.

## [v0.1.7] - 2025-05-23

### Added
- Multi-tag support via `--tag cli ux`
- YAML frontmatter with tag arrays
- Unified `log()` behavior for quick and titled ideas
- Automatic `.md` creation with fallback slugify
- Inline argument parsing for `logflow focus` (e.g. `--title` and `--tag` support)
- Real test fixture for Logflow environments using `initialize_logflow()`
- First full test: `test_focus_inline_parsing`

### Changed
- `next_id.txt` now auto-repairs if empty
- `get_base()` now resolves from `config.toml` or defaults to `Path.cwd() / "logflow"`
- `.gitignore` updated to exclude only generated log files, not source code

### Fixed
- Prevented `ValueError` crash on empty `next_id.txt`
- Eliminated reliance on monkeypatching and global `/tmp` writes in tests
- Ensured all tests pass in local and CI environments

## [v0.1.6] - 2025-05-23


### 🧪 Test and Maintenance Improvements

- ✅ Fixed `test_log_creates_file` to match updated YAML metadata
- ✅ Corrected ID increment test logic to avoid double-advance
- ✅ Updated `test_idea_lifecycle.py` to work with modern `log()` return values
- ✅ Replaced deprecated fixture `patch_base` with `tmp_path` and `monkeypatch`
- 🧹 Prep for cleaner CI and future contributor support

## [v0.1.5] - 2025-05-23

Logflow reaches its first public-ready milestone with export support, notes, and a full metadata system. 🎉

### ✨ New Features
- ✅ Added `logflow export` with markdown/CSV output, filtering by tag/status
- ✅ Added `logflow note` to log timestamped notes and append to idea files
- ✅ `logflow status` now reliably shows the current task or paused state
- ✅ Ideas now include YAML frontmatter with metadata (ID, Title, Tags, Status)
- ✅ `logflow add` auto-generates clean metadata using YAML block
- ✅ Legacy `.md` files are gracefully skipped with warnings during export
- ✅ CLI now supports safe ID sequencing (no reuse after deletes)
- ✅ `logflow purge`, `history`, `focus`, and `index` fully verified
- ✅ Future roadmap added internally as ideas using Logflow itself

### 🔧 Improvements
