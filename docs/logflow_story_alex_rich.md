# ðŸ§  How a Solo Developer Stopped Drowning in Sticky Notes and Found Flow

Alex is a solo developer juggling open-source tools, freelance projects, and the occasional game prototype. Like many devs, her desktop was a war zone of sticky notes, open Notion tabs, and half-finished to-do lists.

> "I kept forgetting what I was working on â€” and worse, why I even started it."

She wanted something minimal. Something that wouldn't slow her down, require another browser tab, or ask her to think like a project manager. She just needed **a place for her dev brain to breathe**.

Thatâ€™s when she found **[Logflow](https://pypi.org/project/logflow-cli/)** â€” a simple command-line tool that helped her capture ideas, log progress, and reflect without context-switching.

## ðŸŽ¬ Act I: Chaos and Capture

On day one, Alex installed Logflow using pipx:

```bash
# ðŸ§  Terminal
pipx install logflow-cli[rich,slugify]
logflow init
```

And then she let her brain loose:

```bash
# ðŸ§  Terminal
logflow add "Build export command for idea tracker" --tag feature
logflow add "Fix confusing error message for empty input" --tag bug
logflow add "Write onboarding docs" --tag docs
```

Each idea was saved with YAML metadata, organized under `logflow/ideas/`. Simple, searchable, trackable.

## ðŸ”„ Act II: Finding Focus

The next day, Alex opened her terminal and ran:

```bash
# ðŸ§  Terminal
logflow focus
```

She picked the export feature (idea `001`), and Logflow quietly logged it in her daily log.

Later, when she hit a wall with CSV formatting, she logged a note:

```bash
# ðŸ§  Terminal
logflow note "Refactor export format to handle empty fields"
```

Now she had a timeline. A breadcrumb trail of how she thought through problems.

As the week went on, she used:

```bash
# ðŸ§  Terminal
logflow status      # to check what she was working on
logflow pause       # to end sessions intentionally
logflow history     # to reflect on what actually got done
```

## ðŸ“¦ Act III: Shipping With Confidence

By Friday, Alex had finished the export feature and wanted to share progress. Instead of screenshots or copy-pasting from memory, she ran:

```bash
# ðŸ§  Terminal
logflow export --tag feature --format table
```

```
| ID  | Title                             | Tag     | Status  |
|-----|-----------------------------------|---------|---------|
| 001 | Build export command for idea tracker | feature | Active  |
```

She shared the output in a team Slack. Feedback came in. Roadmap discussions started. Suddenly, her side project had momentum â€” and so did she.

She wrapped the week with:

```bash
# ðŸ§  Terminal
logflow complete 001
logflow purge
```

And smiled. Because for once, **she wasnâ€™t behind**. She was just... flowing.

## ðŸŽ¯ Why Logflow Works

- ðŸ““ Capture ideas, tasks, and notes in plain-text Markdown
- ðŸ§  Track thinking *and* doing in one CLI workflow
- âœ… No accounts. No clutter. Just your brain, organized

> "I didnâ€™t just get organized. I got clarity."

## ðŸš€ Want to try it?

```bash
# ðŸ§  Terminal
pipx install logflow-cli[rich,slugify]
logflow init
```

Use it in any folder â€” even alongside Git â€” and never lose your dev brain again.
